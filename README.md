# 🌱 Graw-A-Garden-Script

Welcome to **Graw-A-Garden-Script**! This is a beginner-friendly Lua script designed to automate plant growth actions within a Roblox game environment. It's a part of my journey into learning Lua scripting, and I'm open to feedback and improvements.

## 🚀 Features

- **ESP**: The Script have all objects esp with a name filter that should be used.
- **Fly**: Fly with noclip to gather the plants

## 🛠️ How It Works

The script operates by:

1. Entering an infinite loop.
2. Within each iteration, it checks objects around and output every object name.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

To use this script in your Roblox game:

1. **Copy the following `loadstring` command:**

   ```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AF28s/Graw-A-Plant-Script/main/Script.lua"))()
   ```

2. **Execute the command** in your preferred Lua executor while in the game.

   > ⚠️ **Note**: Ensure that the game environment allows the use of external scripts and that you're complying with the game's terms of service.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Script.lua`: The main Lua script containing the automation logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
